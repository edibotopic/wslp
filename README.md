# WSL Plus (wslp)

A CLI tool that wraps the WSL api, making common and bulk operations easier.

## Problem

Some WSL tasks are not convenient to perform using the default WSL CLI.

For example:

* Renaming an instance
* Backing up an instance
* Bulk actions on instances (creating, deleting)
* Generating and managing configuration files

## Todo

- [ ] Bulk actions
